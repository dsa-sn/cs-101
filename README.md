# CS101 -- Programming Fundamentals

By Dakar Software Academy

## Prerequisites

This course is designed to help equip students with the technical skills and foundational knowledge necessary to succeed at Dakar Software Academy.  As such, there are no prerequisites for this course.  

## Course Overview

This course is designed to help students with beginner-level coding experience master
the fundamentals of coding and Computer Science, so that they will be well-equipped to
get the most out of all the other courses they'll take at <strong>Dakar Software Academy</strong>. This course will cover
the foundations of Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming, functions and recursion, debugging,
best practices for solving problems, and how to write clean, structured code.  

### Who should enroll (optional)

Everybody! 

## Learning Objectives

This course will be taught in Python, and will cover the following concepts:

* Variables, assigment, operators, compound assignment operators, precedence
* Data Types (Integers, Floating Point Numbers, Strings, Objects)
* Collections (lists/arrays, tuples, dictionaries)
* String Manipulation (splitting, concatenation, interpolation, special characters)
* Boolean values, operators, expressions, short-circuit evaluation
* Control flow structures and loops (if/elif/else, for, while, break, continue)
* Functions (returning values, parameters, arguments, default values, scoping)
* Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, `self`, inheritance, polymorphism, method overriding)
* Importing libraries/modules/packages
* Running python scripts
* Command-Line arguments
* User input, printing, string formatting
* File I/O (reading from/writing to files)

This course will also cover the following general programming concepts, which can be
applied to any language:

* Semantic variable naming, code formatting, and Conventions
* Breaking down large problems into incremental steps
* Stubbing out functions and methods
* Debugging, printouts, problem isolation
* Purpose of abstractions such as functions, classes, modules
* Thread blocking (function calls, user input, web requests)
* Recursion, infinite loops, progress towards goal (base case)
* Assert statements, basic unit testing
* Error Handling, exceptions (try, catch/except, throw/raise)
* Making HTTP requests to web APIs
* Parsing JSON documents

Finally, this course will also cover the following high-level computer science concepts:

* Pseudocode as an abstraction
* Advantages/disadvantages of interpreted vs. compiled languages
* Language abstraction (High-level vs. low-level vs. assembly vs. machine code)
* Binary number representations
* Persistence of memory (RAM vs. disk)

## Learning Outcomes

Students that complete this course will be able to exhibit the following competencies
in each area:


### General Computer Science Knowledge

**Student(s) will be able to:**

* Select appropriate data types to create, manipulate, and store data.
* Explain the trade-offs between interpreted and compiled languages, and use this knowledge to select appropriate languages for the task at hand.  
* Convert numbers from Decimal to Binary, and from Binary to Decimal.  
* Explain the importance of binary numbers in modern computing, and connect this to
higher-level concepts used in their code such as boolean logic and conditional statements.  

### Programming concepts

**Student(s) will be able to:**

* Write clean, well-structured code with semantic naming conventions for variables,
functions, and objects.  
* Identify patterns that can cause infinite loops, and avoid them as needed.  
* Demonstrate appropriate use of abstraction by refactoring code into modular functions,
classes, and modules as necessary.
* Revise and refactor monolithic code blocks using OOP concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism to make code more readable and reusable.  
*  Investigate problems and debug code, including code that they didn't write.
* Compare and contrast iterative and recursive solutions for coding problems, and explain
the benefits and drawbacks of each.  
* Create basic unit tests and follow the "red-green-refactor" method for writing and improving code.
* Write scripts that make use of 3rd party libraries, modules, frameworks, and/or APIs.
* Assess the potential problems that can arise when making HTTP requests, and effectively
deal with these problems using exceptions.

### Programming in Python

**Student(s) will be able to:**

* Write "clean, Pythonic" code that follows PEP8 conventions.
* Apply their knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming to use inheritance to write "D.R.Y.", reusable code, including abstract superclasses.
* Create, manipulate, and iterate on various collections, including lists, arrays, and tuples.
* Use list comprehensions to programmatically create lists in Python.  
* Create python scripts that can accept arguments at the Command Line when the script is called.  
* Read, modify, and write to files (new or existing) using best practices in Python.
* Explain what the `self` keyword means and how it is used in Python.
* Compare and contrast procedural, Object-Oriented, and functional approaches to solving problems, and select the best approach for the problem at hand.  
* Create basic unit tests in python using the `unittest` module, `Pytest`, or other equivalent libraries.
* Write conditional statements that use short-circuiting to improve runtime.  
* Demonstrate mastery over string concatenation and interpolation in Python.
* Identify the recursive step and base case when shown recursive functions.
* Refactor iterative approaches into recursive functions, and apply their knowledge of each approach to determine which approach has the best time and space complexity.  
* Call a web API and parse the JSON response.
